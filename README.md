# ReactiveUI

### Attempting to recreate a library similar to React & ReactDOM without using a virtual DOM and TS native

#### Current functionality:
- [x] JSX Elements (html & js evaluated)
- [x] useState
- [x] useEffect (state & mounted)
- [ ] Fragments


**The project is built on top of Vite**

This are the features that Vite provides:
  - JSX Parser (Configurable)
  - Typescript config
  - Bundler
  - HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
