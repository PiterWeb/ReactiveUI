# ReactiveUI (React-like Library)

### 🔥 Similar to React 👀
### 🔑 TS Native 🔐
### ❌ No Virtual DOM 📦

#### Current functionality:
- [x] JSX Elements (html & js evaluated)
- [x] useState
- [x] useEffect (state & mounted)
- [x] Fragments (<> </>) [Trying to fix: If you use fragments and there are more elements in the same parent node they will be deleted on the next render] 


**The project is built on top of Vite**

This are the features that Vite provides:
  - JSX Parser (Configurable)
  - Typescript config
  - Bundler
  - HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
