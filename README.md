# ReactiveUI (React-like Library)

### 🔥 Similar to React 👀

### 🔑 TS Native 🔐

### ❌ No Virtual DOM 📦

#### Current functionality:

-   [x] JSX Elements (html & js evaluated)
-   [x] useState
-   [x] useEffect (state & mounted)
-   [x] Fragments (<> </>)
-   [ ] Reusable Components on JSX
-   [ ] Same Statefull Component on the same parent
-   [ ] Selective Re-rendering

**The project is built on top of Vite**

This are the features that Vite provides:
